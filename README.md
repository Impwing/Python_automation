## E-book handler
Ebook-handler is a smooth way of handling large amount of ebooks in the ```Downloads/```
folder.

Currently the only supported platform is macos.

Follow the readme within the folder.

## Folder Manager
Folder Manager: this is a script created for clearing my downloads folder and placing
the contents into a specific path.

## Project Manager
Project Manager: this script is designed for creating and organizing a project folder.
One could add more flexability and versatility to the script but this is a nice MVP.
